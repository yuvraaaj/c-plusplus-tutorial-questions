Problem Statement:

Youâ€™re working with your friend on a project that involves creating some fancy number operations.

Unfortunately, your friend had no idea that function overloading was a thing, so they built a few different functions with different names that all do almost the same operation.

Fortunately, you DO know about function overloading, so you can change all three functions to the same name: fancy_number().
